## What is a globally distributed software team?
In ever-growing IT industry companies for quite some time have embraced the practice of Globally Distributed Software Development. In essence, it means developing software products through collaboration and a combination of different teams or team members across multiple physical locations as opposed to traditional co-located development. Due to the ability to work remotely, distributed team members can live anywhere across the globe which brings both the benefits and potential issues with no guarantee that it will be beneficial in the end (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf). As such, we will try to dive deeper into to the caviats of globally distributed software development, why one should and shouldn't distribute development, look into risk factors of such decision, both in large-and-small to medium size enterprises, and potential solutions through different development and communication methods supported by technical tooling.

### Why should I distribute my team?
Generally, one would consider going to distributed software development when you can no longer grow or sustain your company locally, which can be grouped into several core reasons (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf):
<ol>
<li>The business market proximity advantages
including knowledge of customers and local
conditions.</li>
<li>Pressure to improve time-to-market by using timezone differences and having round-the-clock
development.</li>
<li>Create a pool of globally available skilled resources
to develop software in reduced cost.</li>
<li>Distribution also minimizes the risk in case of
natural catastrophes and other events.</li>
</ol>

While these benefits definitely look alluring one must also consider potential drawbacks and high initial investment costs reflected as monetary costs, time delays, and potential management overhead. As such, globally distributed development should be treated as a double-edged sword that can bring great benefits, but if it is mismanaged and done incorrectly it can not only add large communication and management overhead but can result in a steep increase in expenses with little revenue gain or overall benefit to the company. These dangers and potential solutions how to avoid them will be covered in the following sections.

### On the decision making level

Since distributed development is a decision that effects the whole company, it is neccessary that the decision makers really understand what and why they are doing. While it is possible for "cost savings" to be the only underlying reason for migration towards distributed development, generally, such type of vendor involvment are rare, short lived and does not foster deep partnership level which can quickly lead to "blame game" and potential failure of projects or degradation of operational performance(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075425306001220). As such, executives should look beiond a way to save costs and engage in strategic or tranformational partnership models as proposed by Ben L. Kedia and Somnath Lahiri (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075425306001220). In that way both parties will be able to benefit not only from the advantages that distributed development brings but also from the collaborative effort resulting in a successfull product. As a result all C level executives from both parties should be acivelly involved in laying out their goals, key performance indicators, the focus of their colaboration and most importantly transition and transformation plans (https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10878570210435342/full/html).

While these partnership models should work in every enterprise, there are some difference when we are considering only small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are generally being forced to concentrate their core service activities within their enterprise boundries while out-sourcing some of theier development or operational tasks to low-cost countries in order to maintain competative advantage against large enterprises (https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301351534.pdf). As it was demonstrated in explorative, qualitative research paper by Klimpke et al. (2011)(https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301351534.pdf), such position entails different challanges for SMEs. Primarelly, the flexibility provided by the vendor to rapidly increase the number of out-sourced developers are highly valued as oppose to cost-savings being a driving force in large enterprises. Then there is an issue with cultural and domain knowledge difference which, according Klimpke et al. (2011), are far more apparant in the SMEs than in larger enterprise environments. To thid end SMEs should aim at out-sourcing to a nearshore location as that would help to solve (or at least reduce) cultural and domain knowledge issue. While out-sourcing location does make a difference, SMEs can still benefit (perhaps even more so than larger enterprises) from using previously mentioned partnership models since close relationship with vendor would only benefit flexibility and responsiveness of development demand.
