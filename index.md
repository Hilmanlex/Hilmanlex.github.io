## What is a globally distributed software team?
In ever-growing IT industry companies for quite some time have embraced the practice of Globally Distributed Software Development. In essence, it means developing software products through collaboration and a combination of different teams or team members across multiple physical locations as opposed to traditional co-located development. Due to the ability to work remotely, distributed team members can live anywhere across the globe which brings both the benefits and potential issues with no guarantee that it will be beneficial in the end (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf).

_What else should be discussed here?_
### Why should I distribute my team?
Generally, one would consider going to distributed software development when you can no longer grow or sustain your company locally, which can be grouped into several core reasons (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf):
<ol>
<li>The business market proximity advantages
including knowledge of customers and local
conditions.</li>
<li>Pressure to improve time-to-market by using timezone differences and having round-the-clock
development.</li>
<li>Create a pool of globally available skilled resources
to develop software in reduced cost [1].</li>
<li>Distribution also minimizes the risk in case of
natural catastrophes and other events [9].</li>
</ol>

While these benefits definitely look alluring one must also consider potential drawbacks and high initial investment costs reflected as monetary costs, time delays, and potential management overhead. As such, globally distributed development should be treated as a double-edged sword that can bring great benefits, but if it is mismanaged and done incorrectly it can not only add large communication and management overhead but can result in a steep increase in expenses with little revenue gain or overall benefit to the company. These dangers and potential solutions how to avoid them will be covered in the following sections.
