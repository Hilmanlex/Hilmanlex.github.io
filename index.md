## What is a globally distributed software team?
In ever growing IT industry companies for quite some time have embraced the practice if Globali Distributed Software Development. In essence it means developing software products through collaboration and combination of different teams or team members accross multiple physical locations as opposed to traditional co-located development. Due to ability of working remotely, distributed team members can live anywhere across the globe which brings both the benefits and potential issues with no guarentee that it will be beneficial in the end (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf).

_Copy pasted from a paper https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1006/1006.1955.pdf, should be rephrased or restructured._
<ol>
<li>The business market proximity advantages
including knowledge of customers and local
conditions.</li>
<li>Pressure to improve time-to-market by using timezone differences and having round-the clock
development.</li>
<li>Create a pool of globally available skilled resources
to develop software in reduced cost [1].</li>
<li>Distribution also minimizes the risk in case of
natural catastrophes and other events [9].</li>
</ol>
